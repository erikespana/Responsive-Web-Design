Trying a New Approach

1. Start with the current template.
2. Replace the layout-related <div> tags with Pure CSS classes.
3. Create a copy of styles.css
4. NULL-out those aspects of the CSS related to layout so they don't override the Pure definitions.
5. Make sure to include the styles.css after the Pure file so the Pure styles don't overwrite the mStoner styles.
